                        technlogy, software architecture and systems design, I
                        also love solving problems and abstracting solutions.
                        I'm often found studying software architecture, clean
                        code and new languagens and tools. I have a very

                        and I'm my main interests is in computational modeling
                        for computation problems and bioinformatics.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>I love languages, both the humans and the
                        computer ones. Right now, Iâ€™m working with Typescript,
                        Javascript and Python. Iâ€™m learning Julia, Typescript
                        and Python. I want to learn Rust and Elixir. I also know
                        C/C++, but haven't used in production. About the human
                        languages, Iâ€™m fluent in Portuguese and English. Iâ€™m
                        currently learning Spanish and Japanese and I want to
                        learn Mandarim and French someday.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Besides the languages Iâ€™m working with I also use
                        Docker, AWS, SQL in my everyday work and many other
                        tools/languages. I'm also studying to achieve a AWS
                        certification.
